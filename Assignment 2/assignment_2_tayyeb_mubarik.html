		<h1>Why to boycott Israel Products</h1>
		<p>Israel has been <b>targeting Muslims</b> especially in the <i>Gaza region</i>. They have been a nuisance since the 1940s when <em>WW2</em> saw them being persecuted.</p> Israel is also known as <abbr title="Persecuator">A Monster</abbr> and has caused significant damage and loss of lives with its military force. Since 7<sup>th</sup> October 2023, more than 25,000 Palestenians have lost their lives with most casulaties being <strong> children </strong>. Almost the whole Gaza population has been deprived of food and water(H<sub>2</sub>O).<br /> It is crucial that we as Muslims express unity and boycott <b><i>Israel and Israeli products</b></i>. To do this each Muslim needs to be united in boycotting Israeli made and partnered products. <hr /> Some of the products are: Pepsi, Lays, Mcdonalds, KFC etc. <hr /> We need to <dfn>take a stand together</dfn> and stay united in our mission to hurt the economy of Israel as much as possible so they can stop the <del>persecution </del><ins>genocide</ins> of Muslims in Gaza. Boycott <s>Israel </s> Israel and its supporters.
